Helpful transmogrifier blueprints to extract text or html out of html content. `transmogrify.htmlcontentextractor`
extracts fields from html using XPATH or TAL expressions. `transmogrify.htmlcontentextractor.auto` tries to
automate this process by using cluster analysis and finding where sets of pages differ to determine their
title, description and body.
